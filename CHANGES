Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Added back the required subscriber directives in configure.zcml (which got
  somehow removed) as they are what calls the registerHook and unregisterHook
  method.
- Made the registerHook and unregisterHook methods use the good tool_id
  identifiers to register the before traverse hooks.
